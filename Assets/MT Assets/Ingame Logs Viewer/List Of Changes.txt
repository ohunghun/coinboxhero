	  MT ASSETS
	  CHANGELOG
/////////////////////

v1.5.3
	- The ingame logs viewer component now has an icon!
	- The documentation has been updated to ensure greater clarity, volume of information, tips and minor corrections!

v1.5.2
	- Following the rhythm of Unity Engine versions and to guarantee the good permanent support of this asset,
	  now the minimum recommended version is 2018.1, however, you can still use this asset in the 2017.4 LTS
	  version if you prefer. This will allow this asset to always have the latest features and better and
	  more effective support!

v1.5.1
	- Fixed an issue that generated conflicts when loading a scene that already had a console.

v1.5.0
	- All resources, persistent asset data and other files are now saved in "MT Assets/_AssetsData".
	  This makes it easy to manage all files generated by MT assets and if you need to remove any asset,
	  just delete the asset folder. So, even if you want to remove some MT assets from your project, or
	  update it, you will not lose any files or information that you would like to keep!

v1.4.2
	- Documentation updates.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the compilation or loading time of the scene execution to increase considerably
	  in the editor.

v1.4.1
	- Minor additions to the asset menu.
	- Improvement of some asset codes.
	- Improvements to undo actions.
	- Fixed a bug when importing this asset for the first time, where a file error message was displayed.
	  It was more common with Windows 10 users.
	- There was a slight change in the asset API. Now, to access the API methods of this asset,
	  use "using MTAssets.IngameLogsViewer".
	- The Debugger installer has now changed, the entire installation process is automatic and Ingame Logs
	  Viewer can now detect if any installation has already been performed on your project. If Ingame Logs
	  Viewer has been previously installed, the asset may ask you if you want to install it, just ignore
	  this message.
	- If you experience problems with the log console, please try reinstalling it.

v1.3.1
	- Fix a bug with the welcome message.
	- Small housekeeping in scripts
	- Bug fixes
	- Reduced console interface. Now it will not cover the entire screen! This makes debugging easy in any environment,
	  especially mobile devices!
	- Updated documentation.

v1.2.2
	- The compatibility of the tool has been extended among more Unity versions!

v1.2.1
	- Minor improvements in code.

v1.2
	- You can now hide the touch button to open the console, so you open the console only through the key you have set (Default is F1).
	- Enhancements to the console component UI.

v1.1
	- The minimum support version is now Unity 2018.1.0f2. This change was made to ensure future improvements to the tool! Stay tuned!
	- Small corrections!

v1.0
	- The Ingame Logs Viewer has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
